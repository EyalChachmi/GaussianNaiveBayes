# GaussianNaiveBayes
In this Assignment I have trained a Gaussian Naive Bayes model for continuous features - by calculating the prior probabilities of the classes, computing the mean and standard deviation for the likelihood of the continuous features, and providing a complete fit API.
With the model I've predicted new examples - calculating the posterior probabilities for each class for the test examples, and predicting the class for each test example.
